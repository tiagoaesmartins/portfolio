                <article>
                    <p>I started this journey called "life" in 1991. I grew up surrounded by computers and the Internet, being stimulated to be always curious about the world surrounding me. Since then, I worked a theatre producer and a robotics technician. I started my programming journey in June 2023, and who knows where it will lead me next.</p>
